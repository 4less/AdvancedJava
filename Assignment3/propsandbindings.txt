JavaBeans arose due to the necessity to easily instantiate GUI-Classes.
A Java Bean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. (cite http://openbook.rheinwerk-verlag.de/javainsel/javainsel_10_003.html#dodtpf9755ee2-1779-406b-b8e4-d8c364a2bd33)
JavaBeans have several attributes:
Introspection, which means that that the bean can both be read from outside as well as gathering information
about what is accessing the bean.
Properties save the state of the object in a way that makes it possible to access and customize them.
Components can trigger events, which pass on Information like changes of states.
JavaBeans are also serializable which lets it save and recover its own state.
